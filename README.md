# Introduction
This project implements a client and server for an Internet Relay Chat (IRC) application. The server is able to relay text between clients using websockets. Clients are able to make chatrooms and send messages to rooms for other clients to see.

# Technologies
This was written in Python using the socket, sys, and other select packages. See requirements.txt for full dependency list.
Testing is done using Pytest and unittest.

# Installation
Make sure that you have Python 3.6 or later installed. The following commands will install the project and run the server.

```
git clone https://github.com/<tbd>
cd irc-application
python3 Server.py
```

You will need additional windows to run client applications.

```
